## Potential Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Vulnerable Sharing Functionality**
	- The `vulnerable-share.tsx` file may expose sensitive poll data via insecure URLs.
	- Lack of access control or authentication checks could allow unauthorized access.

2. **Authentication and Authorization Issues**
	- Passwords may be handled insecurely (e.g., stored in plain text).
	- Missing session management or token validation.
	- Insufficient protection of admin routes (e.g., `app/(dashboard)/admin/`).

3. **Input Validation and Output Encoding**
	- Forms like `PollCreateForm.tsx` and `EditPollForm.tsx` may be vulnerable to XSS if user input is not sanitized.
	- Risk of SQL injection if backend queries are not parameterized.

4. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
	- Hardcoded secrets or credentials in config files or source code.
	- Unprotected API endpoints in `lib/actions/` and `supabase/server.ts`.

5. **CSRF and Clickjacking**
	- Forms or actions may be triggered without proper CSRF tokens.
	- Missing security headers like `X-Frame-Options`.

6. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**
	- The `[id]` route under `polls` may allow users to access or modify resources without proper checks.

7. **Dependency Risks**
	- Outdated or vulnerable packages in `package.json`.

8. **Security Misconfigurations**
	- Missing security headers, CORS misconfigurations, or lack of HTTPS enforcement in `next.config.ts` and middleware.

## Patches

### Vulnerable Sharing Functionality

**Patch:**
- Updated `vulnerable-share.tsx` to prevent exposure of sensitive poll data via insecure URLs.
- Only public polls generate a simple shareable link.
- Private polls generate a link with a secure token (if available); otherwise, no link is shown or shared.
- UI disables sharing actions if no secure link is available.
- Added `isPublic` and `shareToken` to `PollSettings` for explicit control.

**Security Impact:**
- Prevents unauthorized access to private poll data.
- Ensures only intended polls are shareable, reducing risk of data leakage.

### Authentication and Authorization Issues

**Patch:**
- Added input validation for email and password in `auth-actions.ts`.
- Enforced password strength requirements (length and complexity).
- Error messages are now generic to avoid leaking sensitive details.
- Improved session management in `auth-context.tsx` to avoid exposing sensitive data.
- Avoided logging sensitive user/session information in `auth-context.tsx`.
- Added role-based access control to `admin/page.tsx` so only authenticated users with the `admin` role can access admin features.

**Security Impact:**
- Reduces risk of weak credentials and brute-force attacks.
- Prevents information leakage through error messages and logs.
- Strengthens session handling and user authentication.
- Prevents unauthorized access to admin-only features and actions.
